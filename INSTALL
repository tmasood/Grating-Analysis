Installation
============

This program was developed under Linux. These instructions are
valid for a UNIX system. Compilation under Windows OS should
work as well. 

Before you compile this program make sure you have LAPACK
installed.

You also need the Bessel library. The library is a subset of the much
larger SLATEC library, which can be downloaded from www.netlib.org.

Unzip and untar the file.

tar -xzvf gratanal-0-0-1.tar.gz

Make sure Makefile points to the appropriate library path where the
lapack library resides.

Type ``make'' at the prompt and enter.
