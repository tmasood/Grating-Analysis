<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>SPOCK (Simulation program for Photonics and Optical Circuit
Knowledge) is a free simulation program for photonic circuits.
The eventual goal is to make this software an essential aid
for optical and photonic circuit analysis (similar to what
SPICE is for electronic circuits).

The software calculates complex eigenmodes of propagation in
plane-layered structures composed of homogenous, isotropic
materials having arbitrary complex dielectric properties.
The formulation allows any number of guiding or non-guiding
layers (what to what your computer memory allows).

<h2>Download</h2>

<p>spock 0.004 is the current version (LINUX only). You can download it

</ul>

<p>spock 0.002 is the old version (LINUX only). You can download it
from:
<ul>
